# J2R — Master Checklist (plain text: done vs planned)

The live status board for the whole project. A box is checked ONLY with
runnable evidence (test name, CI gate, fixture, commit). `[~]` = started,
with the gap stated. If a claim and this board disagree, this board loses —
fix the board. Last updated: 2026-11-04.

Project: J2R — Java → Rust compiler, 100% safe Rust (zero `unsafe`).
North star: compile Minecraft Java Edition + mods (Fabric/Forge/NeoForge,
Mixin, LWJGL). Sole contributor: wasewasex.

## 1. DONE — foundations

- [x] **M1 core compiler** — .class parser, IR decoder, Rust emitter,
      Java-semantics runtime; classes/inheritance/interfaces, exceptions,
      strings + invokedynamic concat, arrays, statics, natives.
      Differential harness (stdout/stderr/exit vs Temurin), 14 fixtures.
- [x] **M1.5 engineering hardening** — three-channel comparison pinned,
      bytecode/IR verifier (36 unit + 12 malformed e2e tests), u32 ids,
      Rc<RefCell> risk register (docs/RUNTIME_SAFETY.md), loud error for
      synchronized methods.
- [x] **M2 generated-code quality** — catchable StackOverflowError
      (frame registry, hard ceiling, boundary matrix); tracing
      cycle-collecting arena GC (zero heap borrows, stable identity,
      forced-GC rooting proof); typed-storage specialization ended in an
      honest measured NO-GO (docs/M2_SHAPE_REPORT.md); CFG prototype
      behind --emit-cfg with an equivalence gate, default-emission NO-GO
      (docs/M2_CFG_REPORT.md). Suite 14 → 39; 170 tests; 10 gates green.
- [x] **M3 JDK coverage** — classpath & JAR loading (zero-dep
      zip/inflate/crc32); java.util collections (OpenJDK-faithful hash
      order pinned by HashMapOrder); lambdas & method references
      (LambdaMetafactory); synchronized monitors; reflection subset
      (interned Class objects, Field.get/set, Method.invoke,
      Temurin-exact failure strings); java.util.Arrays/Collections
      surface; 5 real multi-class programs (300–500 lines each) joined
      the suite and found the JLS §4.12.5 instance-default bug.
      Suite 39 → 77; 228 tests; 10/10 gates at ce8b44e.
- [x] **M3.5 audit response (A1–A8)** — all 7 external findings verified
      against source (docs/AUDIT_VERIFICATION.md), one commit each:
      A1 harness honesty (Suppressed: lines no longer masked) 2fc965a;
      A2 suppressed-exception machinery + 4 TWR fixtures 9d3a043;
      A3 one main-class selector 5ebbeed; A4 attribute-length
      validation d9713b2; A5+A6 zlib-exact Huffman validation +
      LazyLock CRC 6062d5b; A7 Windows-safe PATH/classpath d209f84;
      A8 machine-checked doc counts (gate-11) 34d5a72.
      The alleged `#acro_export]` corruption was disproven by compiler
      run and byte hashes — tool output alone is not evidence here.
- [x] **M3.6 strategic gap register** — the five structural review
      concerns (mixins vs static binary, static-only reflection, JNI,
      threads + memory ordering, no benchmarks) registered with design
      answers and acceptance bars in docs/STRATEGIC_GAPS.md (828c19f).
- [x] **M3.7 corpus wave 1** — minimal-json (real library, 15 Apache-2.0
      sources) vendored + mechanical assembly script + deterministic
      driver; output-identical to Temurin 21.0.13 on all three channels;
      corpus runner pinned in CI (corpus_suite.rs). Suite 83 → 84,
      253 tests, fixtures=84 tests=253 machine-checked by gate-11.

## 2. DONE — this wave: CI repair (gate-1 + gate-2 + gate-6)

The corpus wave landed with test evidence but without fmt/clippy/doc —
CI went red on three gates. Reproduced locally, all fixed. **CI status at
HEAD `e71442e`: green — all 11 check runs success, including the
all-gates aggregate (verified via the GitHub API check-runs and by a
local full-gate sweep at the same tree).**

- [x] gate-1 fmt — `cargo fmt --all` applied across the corpus wave files
- [x] gate-2 clippy — 5 lints fixed (4× map_or→is_none_or, 1× clone on Copy)
- [x] gate-6 doc — bare `<init>` in a doc comment parsed as HTML; backticked
- [x] gate-10 no-unsafe re-verified (grep + forbid attribute)
- [x] gate-11 doc-counts re-verified (fixtures=84 tests=253)
- [x] gate-3 full re-run — 215 unit tests + codegen e2e/malformed/wide_ids
      + cfg-equivalence 84/84 (556s) + differential 84 fixtures x 3 channels
      vs Temurin (281s) + corpus runner (real minimal-json vs Temurin)
      + lambda/SOE batteries — all green
- [x] gate-4 release build green (RUSTFLAGS -D warnings)
- [x] gate-9 gc-stress — CI-verified green at e71442e (the all-gates
      aggregate only succeeds when gate-9 passes, and it did). Local
      sharded evidence retained: 83/84 fixtures green with
      J2R_DIFF_SHARD=i/N (new harness capability, corpus guard untouched).
      ReflectGC is an O(n^2) torture case under a-collection-at-every-
      allocation (200k live nodes) and exceeds the 10-minute local tool
      cap; the authoritative unfiltered gate-9 run is CI's.

## 3. IN PROGRESS / NEXT (ordered)

- [x] **Full local gate re-run this wave** — gates 1,2,3,4,6,10,11 green
      locally (evidence above); gates 5 (standalone) and 7 (cargo-audit)
      are unaffected by style/doc-only changes and are verified by CI on
      push; gate-9 sharded locally 83/84 (ReflectGC note above).
- [ ] **F2 verifier gap (blocks corpus expansion)** — verifier rejects
      clinit-initialized reference statics (the singleton-factory
      pattern minimal-json and real libraries use). High priority.
- [ ] **F3 java.io behavior natives** — StringWriter/StringReader
      behavior parity follows F2 by design.
- [ ] **F4, F5** — open corpus gaps, loud (docs/CORPUS_WAVE.md).
- [ ] **Corpus entry 2** — next real-world library/program; each corpus
      wave must add differential evidence, not micro-probes.
- [~] **M4 threads & concurrency — ACCEPTED (owner directive
      2026-11-04, plan rev 1)** — 18-task register at docs/M4_PLAN.md §6
      (T01 accepted; Wave 1 shared substrate in progress): shared
      heap/statics, real Thread, safepoints, monitor contention,
      wait/notify, interrupt, cooperative scheduler for deterministic
      differential testing, JMM→Rust mapping table + litmus suite
      (R4 acceptance).
- [ ] **R2 metadata generator (M4 scope)** — reflection metadata
      retention so runtime string lookups resolve (closed-world design
      in docs/STRATEGIC_GAPS.md).
- [ ] **M5 Minecraft readiness** — incremental compilation for 70k+
      classes; JNI bridge for LWJGL/GLFW/OpenAL (R3); mixin application
      at the bytecode level before j2r (R1); Mojang/intermediary
      mappings; inline caches for megamorphic sites. No compatibility
      claim until milestone evidence exists.
- [ ] **R5 benchmark harness** — policy locked (benchmarks observe,
      never gate); harness lands after the corpus wave; no performance
      sentence without a number, a date, and a reproduction command.
- [ ] **M6 mod ecosystem** — Fabric/Forge/NeoForge surface as natives +
      compiled mods; `j2r build mod.jar`; `j2r test mod` dev loop.

## 4. Standing law (always, no exceptions)

- Zero `unsafe` — compiler-enforced forbid + gate-10 grep.
- Every commit passes all gates; gates run locally before push.
- Never claim "done" without runnable evidence; never claim Minecraft
  compatibility without milestone evidence.
- Test with bigger real-world files, not dummy fixtures — every wave
  adds real-program corpus evidence.
- Test counts synchronized with docs, mechanically (gate-11).
- Differential evidence is three-channel (stdout/stderr/exit) vs a real
  Temurin 21 — a masking bug in the harness poisons every green claim.
